# Algorithm A5/1 with NIST Test Suite
___

This project implements A5/1 algorithm, offering two initializations: a standard one and an improved version.
Additionally, it includes the implementation of NIST tests, such as Frequency Test, Frequency Test within a Block,
Runs Test, Test for the Longest Run of Ones in a Block, Binary Matrix Rank Test, and Discrete Fourier Transform
(Spectral) Test. This project features two programs: one for encrypting and decrypting binary files using A5/1
algorithm and another for testing the algorithm's randomness using NIST tests.
